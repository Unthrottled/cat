   * Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there
   * lived a king Byteasar IV. As Interkingdomial financial
   * crisis was roaring through the neighborhood, Byteasar was
   * struggling with keeping the economy out of recession.
   * Unfortunately there was not much he could do. After long
   * and deep thinking, the king came to the only solution: one
   * of his cities should be demolished, since keeping
   * communication between all the cities is way too expensive.
   *
   * It is not yet known if Byteasar chose the city to destroy
   * after a careful planning or picked one at random. As a
   * person with PhD in history and Nobel prize in Computer Science,
   * you can solve this mystery. Archaeologists have recently
   * found a manuscript with the information about the roads
   * between the cities, that is now stored in the roadRegister
   * matrix. You want to try and remove each city one by one and
   * compare the road registers obtained this way. Thus you'll be
   * able to compare the obtained roads and determine whether the
   * one picked by Byteasar was the best by some criteria.
   *
   * Given the roadRegister, return an array of all the road
   * registers obtained after removing each of the city one by one.
   *
   * @param roadRegister
   * @return
