   * In a kingdom far, far away, there lives a king Byteasar IX.
   * The history of the kingdom is rich with events and actions,
   * most of which has something to do with the cities of that kingdom.
   * King Byteasar doesn't want to go down in history, and, most of all,
   * he doesn't want to have anything to do with the cities of the kingdom.
   * Cities are lame!
   * <p>
   * Instead, king Byteasar wants to focus on the roads,
   * which is why he issued a new decree: from now on, all roads are
   * considered to be cities, and all cities are considered to be roads.
   * Now his gratefuller subjects pack their livings and move out from
   * the cities to the roads, and the cartographers are busy with building
   * a new roadRegister of the kingdom. All roads of the kingdom are to be
   * named by the cities they connect (i.e. [city1, city2], city1 < city2),
   * sorted lexicographically and enumerated starting from 0.
   * A new road register for such a system should be created.
   * <p>
   * Your task is to help the cartographers with building the new
   * road register. Handle the challenge, and the glorious kingdom of
   * Byteasar IX will never have to deal with the tasks related to cities
   * ever again!
