   * Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there
   * lived a king Byteasar V. His predecessor, king Byteasar IV,
   * lived quite a long life, and when Byteasar V finally
   * ascended the throne, he was already 150 years old.
   * The new king had been preparing all his life for his
   * moment of glory and, scared that he wouldn't have enough
   * time to shine, started his reforms right away. T
   * he first (and, as it turned out, the last) royal decree,
   * issued within a couple of days after the coronation, ordered
   * the following: all the road in the kingdom were to be named.
   * <p>
   * Unfortunately the king didn't have enough time to come up
   * with actual names, so all the roads were to be names with
   * numbers from 0 to roads.length - 1. As a born strategist,
   * Byteasar wanted to make sure that the maps of his kingdom
   * were confusing to enemies, which is why the road names were
   * to be chosen so that no two roads with the neighboring names
   * (i.e. names i and i + 1 for some i) would have a common end
   * at one of the cities.
   * <p>
   * The archicartographer came up with the names for the roads,
   * but he was not sure if the constraint the king imposed was met.
   * He asked the Greater Power to help him check it.
   * As a Greater Power from the future, you are the one
   * who can help with that. Given the names for the roads the
   * archicartographer came up with, check that no two roads with
   * the neighboring names have a common end.
