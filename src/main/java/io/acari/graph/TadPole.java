   * that, given the adjacency matrix representing the contour,
   * will determine whether it's a tadpole or not.
   * <p>
   * The tadpole contour consists of two parts: a head which is
   * a cycle with n (n > 2) vertices, and a tail which is a simple
   * path (with at least one vertex) connected to the head.
