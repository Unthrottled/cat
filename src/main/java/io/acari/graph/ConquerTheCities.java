   * when he ascended the throne, there were n cities in the
   * kingdom, connected by several two-way roads. But before the
   * young king managed to start ruling, the enemy came to the gates:
   * the evil emperor Bugoleon invaded the kingdom and started to
   * conquer the cities day after day.
   * <p>
   * It is not known how long it took to capture each of
   * the cities, but you've recently discovered an ancient
   * chronicle saying that each day Bugoleon captured all the
   * cities that had at most 1 neighboring free city at the moment.
   * Knowing this fact, the number of cities n and all the roads of
   * the kingdom, determine in how many days each of the cities was
   * conquered.
