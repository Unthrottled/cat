   * efficient. The king went down in history as a great road builder:
   * during his reign a great number of roads were built, and the road
   * system he created was the most efficient for those dark times.
   * <p>
   * When you started to learn about Byteasar's III deeds in your
   * history classes, the creeping doubt crawled into the back of
   * your mind: what if the famous king wasn't so great after all?
   * According to the most recent studies, there were n cities in the
   * Byteasar's kingdom, which were connected by the two-ways roads.
   * You managed to get information about this roads from the university
   * library, so now you can write a function that will determine whether
   * the road system in Byteasar's kingdom was efficient or not.
   * <p>
   * A road system is considered efficient if it is possible to
   * travel from any city to any other city by traversing at
   * most 2 roads.
