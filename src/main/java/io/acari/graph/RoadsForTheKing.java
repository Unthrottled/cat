   * Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there
   * lived a king Byteasar II. There was nothing special
   * neither about him, nor about his kingdom. As a mediocre
   * ruler, he did nothing about his kingdom and preferred
   * hunting and feasting over doing anything about his
   * kingdom prosperity.
   * <p>
   * Luckily, his adviser, wise magician Bitlin, was working
   * for the kingdom welfare daily and nightly. However, since
   * there was no one to advise him, he completely forgot about
   * one important thing: the roads. Over the years most of the
   * two-way roads built by Byteasar II predecessors were forgotten
   * and no longer traversable. Only a few roads can still be used.
   * <p>
   * Bitlin wanted each pair of cities to be connected, but couldn't
   * find a way to figure out which roads are missing. Desperate, he
   * turned to his magic crystal, seeking help. The crystal showed him
   * a programmer from the distant future: you! Now you're the only one
   * who can save the kingdom. Given the existing roads and the number
   * of cities in the kingdom, you should use the most modern
   * technologies and find out what roads should be built again to
   * make each pair of cities connected. Since the magic crystal is
   * quite old and meticulous, it will only transfer the information
   * that is sorted properly.
   * <p>
   * The roads to be built should be returned in an array sorted lexicographically, with each road stored as [cityi, cityj], where cityi < cityj.
   *
