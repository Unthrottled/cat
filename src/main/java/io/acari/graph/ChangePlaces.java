   * Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there
   * lived a king Byteasar VI. As any king with such a magnificent
   * name, he was destined to leave a trace in history. Unfortunately
   * imagination wasn't one of king Byteasar's strong suits, so the
   * reform he came up with was quite simple: the king ordered to
   * rename all the cities. He didn't want to come up with new names
   * (as a king, he'd have to remember them all!), so he ordered the
   * cities to swap their names in such manner that the ith city would
   * have the name of the city number (i + 1)th. The last city in the
   * Byteasar's kingdom would, naturally, get the name of the very first
   * city.
   * <p>
   * The cartographers were not happy with this reform, since they had
   * to redraw all the maps of the kingdom. Before the reform, information
   * about all the roads between the cities were stored in the roadRegister.
   * Prior to drawing maps, they had to start with updating the register.
   * Your task is to find out what the updated register looked like.
   * <p>
   * The king is a dick.
