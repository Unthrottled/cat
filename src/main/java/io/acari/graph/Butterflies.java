   * Today you want to teach your program to recognize butterfly patterns,
   * which means that you need to implement a function that, given the
   * adjacency matrix representing the contour, will determine whether it's a butterfly or not.
   * <p>
   * The butterfly contour looks like this:

   * <img src="https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/isButterfly/img/butterfly.png?_tm=1495120253756"/>
   * <p>

   * represented by adjacency matrix adj determine whether it's a butterfly or not.

   * @return
