   * Last night you partied a little too hard.
   * Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral!
   * You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply
   * the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.
   *
   * The pixels in the input image are represented as integers.
   * The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way:
   * Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value
   * of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself.
   * All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.
   *
   * Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
   *
   *
   * @param image
   * @return
